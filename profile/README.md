# Franz Valles Media
We are a small organization who runs [Sechipeanut](https://sechipeanut.me).

# About
FVM was established in late 2018 as a group for my social media accounts. Since the pandemic, content creation made a whole new experience, leveraging social media platforms like TikTok and Facebook to share experiences during the hard times.

# The Team
**The team behind FVM is just a small circle of friends.** The idea was to leverage social media by making content that is relevant to the current situation and trend.

- This is me. I am a GitHub Campus Student leveraging the platform to develop apps and websites that will make lives easier.
- I am the founding member of Franz Valles Media, and it's just me.
- I am a streamer, and a content creator, hence why this org was made.
